## Description 

# SmartTable with SmartFilter Bar

## Overview

The **SmartTable** project is a web-based application that allows users to view and interact with data from the **Northwind OData services**. This project leverages a **SmartFilter Bar** to filter the data based on various criteria and displays the filtered data in a tabular format. Additionally, users can click on a single record in the table to navigate to a details page that shows more in-depth information about the selected record.

This project is a great example of utilizing modern web technologies to work with OData services and to provide a user-friendly interface for filtering, viewing, and interacting with data.

## Features

- **SmartFilter Bar**: A dynamic and interactive filter bar that allows users to filter the displayed data based on multiple filter criteria.
- **Data Table (SmartTable)**: A responsive table that displays the filtered data in a structured format.
- **Record Navigation**: Clicking on any row in the SmartTable will take the user to a separate page where they can view the complete details of the selected record.
- **Northwind OData Service**: The data is fetched from the publicly available Northwind OData services, which provides sample business data related to orders, customers, products, and more.

  ## How It Works

### SmartFilter Bar:
- The SmartFilter Bar is a key component of the application. It allows users to filter the data displayed in the table based on multiple criteria.
- The filters are dynamic, meaning they automatically update the available filtering options based on the data retrieved from the OData service.

### SmartTable:
- The SmartTable is a responsive table that displays the filtered data from the Northwind OData service.
- Each row in the table corresponds to a record, such as an order or a customer.
- The table automatically updates to show only the records that meet the criteria specified by the user in the SmartFilter Bar.

### Record Navigation:
- When a user clicks on a row in the table, the application navigates to a new page where the complete details of the selected record are displayed.
- This functionality allows users to view more detailed information about a single record, such as customer details, order items, or product information.
